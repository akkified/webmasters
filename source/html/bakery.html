      <h1 class="text-center page-title">Design Plans</h1>
      <p class="text-center 50px"> Our website features the Restaurant, “Herb Essence.” This restaurant is an Indian 
        food fusion restaurant where vegetarian Indian dishes are served with a modern and innovative take on it.
        Our website first features a warm and inviting atmosphere for vegetarian diners by showcasing greenery colors like 
        green, and colors like white and biege. Using these  colors helps us create a simple yet enticing website for users to interact and
        appease their eyes with. Furthermore, we plan on creating an “about us” page that highlights our restaurant as
        we explain our history and processes of how fresh our food is, how it is processed and delivered, and how we provide eco-friendly 
        sustainability to help promote a greater environment. This page will replace the current Run-off 
        page as after the run-off, we will change this to be more intune with the history of our restaurant and its processes.
        In the menu section we will highlight all the food that we offer, and the main core dishes will feature a process on how it's made and highlights how fresh it is. We also have a “cart” option
        button that customers can click to allow them to order carry out by adding items to their cart and inputting card information, email, 
        phone-number, and email which is something we want to add to the current cart option. For our main homepage, we included different shades
        of green and the color white to create an appeasing aesthetic with our logo at the top right to show what Restaurant it is. 
        We also included our logo in the top left which follows the options of "Drinks","Pizza","Run-off(will be changed to about us)", 
        "Menu", and "Cart." All these words when you click them take you to the specific part of the website for what you clicked on.
        Furthermore, we included a picture of one of our most popular pizza's underneath the top green banner with an advertisement that shows
        offers within the restaurant which changes depending on the time of day. Moreover, we have a statement below this that explains
        our restaurant value and goals. Underneath this, we have a brief "about us" which explains our restaurant. Next to it,
        We have buttons and graphics for "Menu", "Drinks", "Run-off", and "Pizzeria" to take you to the respective part of the site
        We also have a reactive site as pulling the website on different devices will adjust our website to the appropriate size of the screen. 
        The graphics of these choices also allow an aesthetic and pleasing design as it offers a dark and light contrast with the biege background,
        allowing for a warm yet alert feeling for our website. Now, moving to the drink section. Right now, we have
        a good selection of drinks that are avaliable with the prices. These drinks can be added to the cart of the user. 
        For a further design, we want to keep the way the drinks are being showcased as it allows the user to see a lot of options
        and reduces scrolling and user finger fatigue while still showcasing all the drinks. We also want to change the graphic of
        drinks to be more realistic and add more drinks that are different. We also want to showcase our most
        popular drinks as a bigger graphic than the others and provide a brief description under them about how its made
        and how we are saving the enviornment by being eco-friendly in using reuseable glass containers and paper straws.
        For the pizza section, we already have a good selection of pizzas of Indian fusion food which showcases the item and prices. We want
        to also highlight the most popular pizzas with a bigger graphic and highlight how they are made, what ingredients are used, 
        highlight how it is fresh and sourced locally. For the Run-off page, we will change it to the about us page which 
        will feature pictures along the left and right side of the page. Captions on either the left or right side of the picture
        depending on its position will describe the history, process, commit to change in enviornment based on what the picture
        is showing. We want the captions to be outlined with a green border as well to continue our theme. At the bottom, we will also design a green banner which will include contact information which will give information
        on the restaurant's email, phone number, and location and we will include positive reviews and comments that customers
        have made about our restaurant. For the menu page, we already have a dropdown option for users
        with all the different foods avaliable like "Appetizers" and "Soups". Right now, there are no graphics for the food
        as we would like to change the menu a bit more and make it a bit condensed. We also want to change the color theme to 
        fit our style which would include green dropdown boxes with a biege background. Also, for each dropdown, we want to highlight
        two of the most popular foods which will provide a brief description under it highlighting how it is made, and the source of 
        ingredients, and how it promotes eco-friendliness. For the cart button, we already have a working cart where
        customers can add food/drinks to the cart form the other pages of the website and they can input their name. Once they
        submit it, an email is sent to our email in which we can see what order they placed and whose name it is under. We want
        to further implement more features where they provide us with their card information, email-address, and phone number
        to help create a smoother transaction and help resolve problems.  </p>
